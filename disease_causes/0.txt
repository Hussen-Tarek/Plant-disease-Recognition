Bacterial leaf spot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, is the most common and destructive disease for peppers in the eastern United States. It is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can survive in seeds and plant debris from one season to another, Disease symptoms can appear throughout the above-ground portion of the plant, which may include leaf spot, fruit spot and stem canker. However, early symptoms show up as water-soaked lesions on leaves that can quickly change from green to dark brown and enlarge into spots that are up to 1/4 inch in diameter with slightly raised margins.
