Late blight caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans is one of the most serious diseases of potato worldwide and can completely destroy a crop, resulting in 100% yield loss. In the 1840s, it caused the Irish Potato Famine that killed a quarter of a million people through starvation and caused another million or so to immigrate to the United States (Arneson, 1998). Currently, it causes substantial economic losses in both conventional and organic potato production systems throughout the EU.
