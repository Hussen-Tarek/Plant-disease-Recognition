Tomato mosaic virus symptoms can be found at any stage of growth and all parts of the plant may be infected. They are often seen as a general mottling or mosaic appearance on foliage. When the plant is severely affected, leaves may look akin to ferns with raised dark green regions. Leaves may also become stunted. Infected plants may have a severe reduction in fruit set and those that do set may be dotted with yellow blotches and necrotic spots while the interior of the fruit is brown. Stems, petioles, leaves and fruit may all show signs of infection.
