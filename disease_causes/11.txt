Target spot is often a problem on tomatoes in Florida. The disease is caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola. Target spot is frequently misdiagnosed as in its early stages as symptoms are difficult to recognize and can be confused with bacterial spot and early blight.
The name derives from the bull’s eye appearance that is often displayed in lesions caused by the disease. Since concentric rings are not always visible, and not all lesions with concentric rings are target spot, it is recommended that a laboratory diagnosis be obtained to ensure a correct diagnosis.
