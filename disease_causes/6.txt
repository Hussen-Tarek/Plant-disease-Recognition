The early blight fungus can come from many sources. It can be in the soil, or it can already be on seeds or seedlings you purchase. It can even over-winter in the diseased debris of your tomato plants and it can persist in the soil or debris for at least one year.1 Although early blight can occur in any type of weather, it favors damp conditions, like frequent rain or even heavy dews.
