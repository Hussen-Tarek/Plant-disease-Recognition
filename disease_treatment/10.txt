Natural enemies of mites are present in and around fields and can keep mite populations low. Many insecticides used for control of insect pests severely reduce numbers of beneficial insects that keep mite populations in check. Therefore, apply insecticides only asâ€‘needed, rather than at regularly scheduled intervals. When possible, select pesticides which will have the least impact on beneficial insects.
