Treating septoria leaf spot disease after it appears is achieved with fungicides. The chemicals need to be applied on a seven to ten day schedule to be effective. Spraying begins after blossom drop when the first fruits are visible. The most commonly used chemicals are maneb and chlorothalonil, but there are other options available to the home gardener. Potassium bicarbonate, ziram, and copper products are a few other sprays useful against the fungus. Consult the label carefully for instructions on rate and method of application.
