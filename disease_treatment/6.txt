Tomatoes that have early blight require immediate attention before the disease takes over the plants. Thoroughly spray the plant (bottoms of leaves also) with Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide concentrate or Bonide Tomato & Vegetable. Both of these treatments are organic. If possible time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows applications. A day after treatment, remove the lower branches with sharp razor blade knife. Clean your knife with rubbing alcohol before trimming the next plant to prevent the spread of the disease. Repeat fungicide treatments every 7 to 14 days. Read the label instructions carefully. Do not spray pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers or herbicides when it’s in the high 80’s or 90; you can damage your plants. Water your plants the day before spraying, hydration is important!
